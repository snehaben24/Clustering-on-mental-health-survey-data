# Clustering on Mental Health Survey Data üß†üîç

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and clustering data from a mental health survey. The aim is to identify patterns and groups based on responses, providing valuable insights into mental health trends and factors that influence them.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardize inconsistent responses in the dataset, especially in columns such as gender.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Implement clustering algorithms to segment the data into meaningful groups.
- **Insights Generation**: Derive actionable insights from the clustered data to better understand mental health demographics.

## Data Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Import**: Load the mental health survey dataset using Pandas.
2. **Standardization**: Map inconsistent gender entries to standardized categories for clearer analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify unique values, outliers, and distribution of key features.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Prepare data for clustering by selecting relevant columns and handling missing values.

## Clustering Methodology
- **Algorithm Used**: K-Means Clustering and other suitable clustering techniques to group data.
- **Feature Selection**: Utilize key survey responses and demographic data as clustering features.
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics like silhouette scores to assess cluster validity and interpretability.

## Results and Insights
- The clustering process reveals distinct patterns in the dataset, highlighting correlations between demographic factors and mental health conditions.
- Notable insights include prevalent mental health challenges in specific age groups and how gender representation impacts the responses.

## Future Scope
- **Model Enhancement**: Explore additional clustering algorithms (e.g., hierarchical clustering) for deeper analysis.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Incorporate machine learning models to predict mental health outcomes based on survey responses.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Develop a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing and interacting with the clustered data.

## Project Requirements
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for code execution and documentation

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure required libraries are installed (`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`).
3. Run the `analysis.ipynb` notebook to see the full analysis and clustering results.
